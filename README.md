Testing GitHub
This is my first GutHub project.
Recently I started working for a IT company as a trainee, with no IT background at all.
While studying java as an introduction to coding I realized that coding is awesome. 
Now I am considering using GitHub for my coding projects. 
They will likely be insignificant and boring, but they make me feel great.

Peace!
